# Crowdfunding-Analysis

# Project Overview
This project analyzes crowdfunding campaigns using real-world data from Kickstarter. The aim is to gain insights into campaign performance, identify success factors, and provide actionable insights for future projects. The analysis covers:
- Project outcomes based on location, category, and time.
- Successful projectsâ€™ funding, backers, and duration.
- Top successful projects by backers and amount raised.
- Success rates overall, by category, time, and goal range.

# Dataset Description
The dataset includes information on over 100,000 Kickstarter campaigns with the following key columns:
- **id**: Unique identifier for each project
- **state**: Project status (e.g., successful, failed)
- **created_at, deadline, launched_at**: Timestamps for project lifecycle
